# Command Line Classmates

This tiny app was a project created while at the [Flatiron School's Full-Stack Immersive Bootcamp](https://flatironschool.com/programs/nyc-software-engineering-immersive/).  It is a command-line tool that scrapes the contact information of the students in BK001 from our profile website using Nokogiri. Then it opens the contact page of the desired student with launchy.
